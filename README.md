Final Opinon 
This assigment was pretty tough. I think I learned a fair bit from it and I spent alot of time on trial and error. I got stuck several times and reached out for help. 

My Work
The frist issue I ran into was making anything run after the promtps finished. I tried meny thing like changeing the function and the order but it wasn't working. The issue turned out to be return that wasn't needed. After the return was removed I was able to make if statments that console.log the values that the user wanted. I than made more if statments to try and make the program pick a random character for each of the values that were ture and skipping values that were false. I tried to have it run in a for loop at frist, however it would not loop. After some trial and error I did some research and found while loops and do while loops which seem to be related to for loops. I experiment with them and they gave me a few differant results but none were what I needed. I reached out for help again and with that help I stream lined the project a bit. I was than able to make an array with the data from all the arrays that were ture and the preson who helped me subjested to use a while loop. I to work thought building the new code to make the array and password and it was going well enough but I again ran into same trouble. I had code and the while loop ran but it did not stop. I reached out for help a final time in my classes office hours and with one final push and few changes the program finally ran.
